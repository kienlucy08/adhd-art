                    Dreams Ocean: we were all staying at a beach hut for
                    something and it was right on the coast sage was there. A
                    storm came in and took out our rooms and then it died down.
                    Then I took sage and we tried to retrieve my all of our
                    stuff, I got most stuff including my makeup bag some mermaid
                    stuff and little George. I woke up because I refreshed
                    everything. This dream might have been linked with dream I
                    had before where we were going to the bottom of the ocean
                    for research and I was scared cause the ocean is scary. We
                    were in a capsule and in the green creepy layer of the ocean
                    then we reached our location where they put grace and I in
                    and lowered the pressure.
